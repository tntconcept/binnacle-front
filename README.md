This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
- `npm run start` Runs the app in development mode and opens the browser at `http://localhost:3000`
- `npm run build` Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
- `npm run test` Runs the **JEST** test watcher in watch mode (Every time you save a file, it will re-run the tests). By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.

## How to start the app
Before all:
- Clone the [back-end repository](https://github.com/autentia/binnacle-api-kotlin)
- Run `docker-compose up` in the back-end project root folder
- Run Spring Boot

1. Run `yarn install` or `npm install` to install the dependencies
2. Run `yarn start` or `npm start` to start the development server.

## Cypress component testing
You can unit test your components using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io) to run the the component in the real browser with the full power of Cypress E2E test runner.

In this way is easier to perform:
- Interaction tests:  render a component and then interact with it in the browser, asserting things about the way it renders and changes.
- Visual regression tests: capture screenshots of every scenario and compare them against known baselines. Theyâ€™re great for catching UI appearance bugs.
- Accessibiliy tests
- Cross browser testing

You can learn more about this aproach at [Cypress React Unit Test](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-react-unit-test)

> In the components folder we put the features component that each page have. For example: LoginForm component feature of login page.

The component tests that support cypress component testing must have the `.spec.tsx` file extension.
Run `yarn cypress` or `npm run cypress` to open the Cypress UI and select the component test that you want to run.

If you want to run all cypress tests then run `yarn cypress:run` or `npm run cypress:run`.

## Cypress integration testing or E2E tests
Integration tests check that backend and frontend works and tests happy paths of each page. For example: Checks that given a valid username and password the user can login successfuly and see the dashboard page.

## E2E login workaround
In production, for security reasons, the access token and refresh token are stored in memory, but this means that before each E2E test the login step must be made so that the http requests include the access token in the header.

To save time and avoid the login step, the token manager detects when the app runs the E2E tests and saves the token in the session storage.
`cy.smartLoginTo` is a new Cypress command that ignores the login step if the token already exists in the session storage.
